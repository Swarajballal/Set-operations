#Task 4 - Now that we have learnt the basics of Python programming language, let's get our hands dirty and create a new python program. Write a Python Program to Illustrate Different Set Operations.
#Here we have to define two set variables and we have to perform different set operations: union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference.

E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

#union
print("Union of E and N is",E | N)

#intersection
print("Intersection of E and N is",E & N)

#difference
print("Difference of E and N is",E - N)

# symmetric difference
print("Symmetric difference of E and N is",E ^ N)
